## Notifications and notification subscriptions
{: #oc_eventsubscription}

You can always know the status of your environment by checking the Status page. As they occur, incidents and scheduled disruptive maintenance update events are reported on the Status page. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also sends notifications to the Notifications area on the Administration page for events such as scheduled or pending maintenance updates.

### Notifications

You can view notifications for your local or dedicated environment to monitor the status of your environment. Review the following table for information about the different types of notifications and where each notification type is posted.

### Setting up notification subscriptions
{: #seteventsub}

You can extend the functionality of the notifications that are sent to the Administration page and the Status page by using notification subscriptions. Use notification subscriptions to set up a custom email or use webhooks to integrate with a tool of your choice.
 * If you select the email option, your notifications are sent to the email addresses that you specify. You can select notifications of incidents, maintenance updates, or thresholds. An initial email notification is sent. Then, if the event has a change made to it, another notification with the change is sent each time a change is made.  
 * If you select the webhooks option, your notifications are routed directly to a destination of your choice, such as a phone number (by SMS message). You can customize the type of notification, specifically maintenance updates, critical incident alerts, or thresholds. You can customize whether to receive new notifications or notifications about changes to subscriptions, and what information is included in the body of each notification.

**Note**: Only users with the Superuser permission (`ops.admin`) can set up notification subscriptions.

To create an email or webhook subscription from the **Notification Subscriptions** page, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Notification Subscriptions** page.  Go to **SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; Environment &gt; Subscriptions**.
2. Click **Add Subscription**.
3. Complete the notification subscription form.

  * To create email notification subscriptions about maintenance updates or incidents, see the information in [Table 3](index.html#emailnotmaintinc).
  * To create email notification subscriptions about thresholds, see the information in [Table 4](index.html#emailnottrhesh).
  * To create webhook notification subscriptions about maintenance updates or incidents, see the information in [Table 5](index.html#webhooknotsub).
  * To create webhook notification subscriptions about thresholds, see the information in [Table 6](index.html#webhooknotthresh).

4. After you complete the form, you can choose from the following options:

  * Click **Save** to save the subscription to your notification subscription list.
  * Click **Save and Test** to save and test the notification.
  * Click **Save and Close** to save the subscription to your notification subscription list, and return to the previous page.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Enabled | Select the option to enable the email notifications. Clear the selection to disable the email notification. Subscriptions are enabled by default. |
| Type | Select **Email**. |
| Event | Select **Threshold**. |
| Threshold | Select the type of threshold you want to be notified about: Average CPU, Organization Quota, Physical Disk, Physical Memory, Reserved Disk, or Reserved Memory. |
| Threshold Direction | Select the direction that you want the data to be moving in, either Ascending or Descending, when it passes the Notify When Crossing value that you set. For example, if the Notify When Crossing value is 50%, and the direction is descending, you are notified only if the usage percentage goes from 50% or more to less than 50%.  If you set the direction to ascending, you would be notified when the usage percentage goes from less than 50% to more than 50%.   |
| Notify When Crossing Above (%) | Enter the threshold percentage at which you want to be notified. If you chose the Ascending property in the Threshold Direction field, the email notification is sent when the threshold rises above this percentage. |
| Notify When Crossing Below (%) | Enter the threshold percentage at which you want to be notified. If you chose the Descending property in the Threshold Direction field, the email notification is sent when the threshold drops beneath this percentage. |
| Description | Add a unique description for the subscription that you are creating. |
| Subject | Enter the subject line for the email. This is a required field.  |
| Message Body | Enter the message body text to be sent in the email. You can use the IBM payload values to populate the email notification with pertinent information. See the [Threshold payload section values](index.html#threshpayload) table to identify which values you can use. Use basic HTML tags to structure your email. This is a required field. |
| To | Enter the email address or addresses using a comma-separated list for the recipients of the email notification. Expand the "cc" or "bcc" options to copy others on the email. This is a required field. |
{: caption="Table 4. Fields for email notification subscriptions about maintenance updates or incidents" caption-side="top"}

Threshold data is collected once every 6 hours. A notification is sent only once when the value crosses the threshold value you set. If you chose ascending, a new notification is not sent unless the value drops below the threshold and then increases above the threshold again. Likewise, if you chose descending, you are notified only if the value rises above the threshold you set and then drops below the threshold again.

If you don't want to wait 6 hours for the notification to be sent when the threshold is met, after completing the fields on the form you can click **Save and Test** to receive a test notification with sample data.  

An Organization Quota threshold notification includes only the organizations that have crossed the specified threshold percentage in the 6 hour time period corresponding to that notification. Organizations that have crossed a threshold during previous 6 hour time periods will not be included, even if they remain above or below the threshold.  The three resources that make up an organization's quota (reserved memory, services, and routes) are considered independently when determining if an organization quota notification should be sent. For example, if the amount of reserved memory used by an organization crosses 50% of the organization's quota, an Organization Quota threshold configured with a value of 50% would result in a notification being sent.  If the number of services used by the same organization crosses 50% of the organization's quota at a later point in time, even though the amount of memory used remains unchanged, the same Organization Quota threshold subscription would also result in a notification being sent.

Threshold data is collected once every 6 hours. A notification is sent only once when the value crosses the threshold value you set. A new notification is not sent unless the value drops below the threshold, if you chose ascending, and then increases above the threshold again. Likewise, if you chose descending, you are only notified again if the value rises above the threshold you set and then drops below the threshold again.

If you don't want to wait 6 hours for the notification to be sent when the threshold is met, after you complete the fields on the form, you can click **Save and Test** to save and test the notification with sample data.

An Organization Quota threshold notification includes only the organizations that have crossed the specified threshold percentage in the 6 hour time period corresponding to that notification. Organizations that have crossed a threshold during previous 6 hour time periods will not be included, even if they remain above/below threshold.  The three resources that make up an organization's quota, reserved memory, services, and routes, are considered independently when determining if an organization quota notification should be sent. For example, if the amount of reserved memory used by an organization crosses 50% of the organization's quota, an Organization Quota threshold configured with a value of 50% would result in a notification being sent.  If the number of services used by the same organization crosses 50% of the organization's quota at a later point in time, even though the amount of memory used remains unchanged, the same Organization Quota threshold subscription would also result in a notification being sent.

When your notification subscription is saved, you receive notifications through the method that you set up. Notifications still post in the following locations:  
 * On the Status page for incidents
 * On the Status page for the scheduled disruptive maintenance update events
 * In the Notifications area of the Administration page for maintenance updates

You can select any saved notification subscription, view the recent activity, or edit as you need. Click to expand any recent activity entry to view the history details.

## Maintenance updates
{: #oc_schedulemaintenance}

You can view scheduled and pending maintenance updates, if you have the superuser permission (`ops.admin`), by clicking **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending** to access the **Maintenance Updates** page.  All users of your environment can view the scheduled disruptive maintenance update events by clicking **Support** &gt; **Status**.

**Note**: See the following section for [Setting preapproved update windows](index.html#preapprovedmaintenance) to get you started. These windows must be set in order for IBM to schedule maintenance for your environment.

<dl>
<dt>Non-disruptive updates</dt>
<dd>A non-disruptive update does not affect your environment, your running applications, or your users' access to your applications. This update type does not require case-by-case approval and will be applied during the preapproved, available maintenance windows that you set from the Maintenance Updates page.
<p>**Note**: Some platform services might require that at least one non-disruptive change window be defined during a set of predetermined time-slots at the service's discretion. Please check the service description for each dedicated service deployed to your environment.</p></dd>
<dt>Disruptive updates</dt>
<dd>A disruptive update might affect your environment, running applications, or your users' access to your applications. You must schedule and approve each of these maintenance updates within the allotted 21-day maintenance window. You can select the suggested deployment date and time, the option for any of your preapproved windows, or you can open the calendar to select three specific dates and times for IBM to choose from when scheduling the update.</dd>
</dl>


### Setting preapproved update windows
{: #preapprovedmaintenance}

Non-disruptive maintenance updates are scheduled to run during preapproved windows of time. The following update windows are created by default in every system on Mondays and Wednesdays (GMT):

<ul>
<li>01:00AM - 07:00AM (GMT)</li>
<li>09:00AM - 03:00PM (GMT)</li>
<li>05:00PM - 11:00PM (GMT)</li>
</ul>

You can change the default settings in one of the following ways:
 * Edit the default update windows by choosing a different day or a different start time, or both
 * Create an update window and then delete the default update window

To save your changes, you must still meet the required minimum of time each week.

You are required to set a minimum of 12 available hours in a week for a minimum of two days during each week. For example, you can set six-hour windows across two separate days, or you can set four-hour windows across three separate days. To ensure that the windows provide enough time for an update to be applied, each window must be a minimum of 4 hours in duration.  

**Note**: Only users with the Superuser permission (`ops.admin`) can schedule and approve maintenance updates.

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending &gt; Manage Availability**.
2. Navigate to the **Update Windows** section.
3. Click **Add new**.
4. Set your first update window by selecting the frequency, duration, and start time for the window.
5. Optional: Select **Mark as preferred**, if you'd like to set your recurring update window as a preferred time for deployments to be scheduled. Preferred windows are given priority, when possible.
6. Click **Submit**.
7. Repeat this process until you have met the minimum requirements for the weekly windows.

### Setting blackout windows
{: #blockpreapprovedmaintenance}

You can choose to set specific blackout windows of time in which your environment is not available for non-disruptive maintenance updates. For example, you might choose a high traffic weekend or holiday when you do not want to apply any maintenance to ensure that your applications are available for your users.

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending &gt; Manage Availability**.
2. Navigate to the **Blackout Windows** section.
3. Click **Add new**.
4. Set your blackout window by selecting the frequency, duration, and start time for the window.
5. Click **Submit**.

Blackout windows will require IBM approval, and the time it takes to gain approval will vary. Blackouts windows that overlap with a deployment already scheduled to take place within 7 days of the time the blackout is submitted may take longer to approve. When the requested blackout is approved, IBM will cancel any existing updates that are currently scheduled during the blackout window. IBM will also create new records for these updates and schedule them outside the approved blackout dates.

### Scheduling and approving updates
{: #scheduleandapprove}

After you set your update windows, non-disruptive updates will be automatically scheduled during those times. Your explicit approval for these types of updates is not required. However, you can view the details for each maintenance update including what is being updated, how long the update will take, and when the update is scheduled.

To view the details for a non-disruptive update, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending**.
2. Identify any rows that have **Customer Scheduling Required** set to **No**.
3. Select the row for that update to view the details.

A disruptive update might affect your environment, running applications, or your users' access to your applications. You must schedule and approve each of these maintenance updates within the alloted 21-day maintenance window. You can select the suggested deployment date and time, the option for any of your preapproved windows, or you can open the calendar to select three specific dates and times for IBM to choose from when scheduling the update.

For disruptive updates that do require your approval, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending**.
2. Identify any rows that have **Customer Scheduling Required** set to **Yes**.
3. Select the row for that update to review the details for the update including the update description, suggested date and time for the update, the affected components, and duration for the update.
4. Select **Schedule and Approve**.
5. Choose from the following options: **Suggested date**, **Alternative dates**, or **Any preapproved window**. If you select **Alternative dates**, you can open the calendar to select three options for IBM to choose from.
6. Optional: From the list of selected alternative dates in the calendar, select the ones that you want to be set as preferred dates for deployment. Each selected date is noted as preferred for the deployer who is scheduling the deployment. IBM attempts to schedule maintenance during preferred update windows.
7. Select **Submit** when you are finished.

Based on your selection, the update is scheduled for deployment during the suggested date that you accepted, during one of your preapproved windows, or one of the specific dates and times that you selected. When the update is scheduled for deployment by IBM, you see the scheduled date reflected in the details for the update on the **Maintenance Updates** page. You can reschedule an already planned deployment only if a day (24 hours) before the scheduled start date and time remains. Once you have rescheduled a deployment, you can't reschedule it again.

	<dt><strong>Reserved</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total amount of memory or disk space that is available to be reserved by all deployed and running applications in your environment. Because applications rarely use all of the memory that is reserved by them, the physical value is usually less than the reserved value.</dd>
	</dl>

In addition to the graphical representation, you can see the percentage of memory and disk space that your environment is using. You can also see both the reserved and the physical amounts, in GB, of the actual usage compared to the amount that is available.

To see the usage of your memory, disk, or CPU by DEA, click **Breakdown**.  

To see more detailed information about your physical and reserved memory or disk usage over time, click **History.** You can view usage for the last 48 hours, the last 30 days, or the last 5 months. The points displayed for the last 48 hours represent the actual data that is collected once an hour. The points displayed for the last 30 days represent the average value for each day. The points displayed for the last 5 months represent the average value for each month. The last 30 days and last 5 months views can also display the maximum value for each day or month by toggling the radio button at the top of the chart. The historical usage view shows a graph of memory or disk usage over the time you choose.  
	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Reserved Limit</strong></dt>
	<dd>Shown as a horizontal dashed line, the Reserved Limit is the total amount of memory or disk space that can be collectively reserved by all of the applications running in your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Reserved</strong></dt>
	<dd>The Reserved line shows the memory or disk space that is currently collectively reserved by all of the applications running in your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Physical Limit</strong></dt>
	<dd>Shown as a horizontal dashed line, the Physical Limit shows the amount of physical memory or disk space that was purchased for your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Physical</strong></dt>
	<dd>The Physical line shows the amount of memory or disk space that is actually being used.</dd>
	</dl>
	
For each of the available historical usage views, at least two data points are required for the graph to render. This equates to data for at least two hours during the last 48 hours, two days during the last 30 days, and two months during the last 5 months. For the 30 day and 5 month views, partially complete averages or maximum values are returned for the current day or month and will adjust as more data is collected.

The data powering these views is available via the [Metrics API](/docs/admin/index.html#envappmetricsapi). To see the actual API endpoints and data used to generate the view, click on the **Learn more about the API** link above the chart. If you click on any of the links in the dialog that appears, a new tab will open in your browser containing the JSON response of the metrics API endpoint. 

#### Service usage details
{: #servicesresourceusage}

The **Service** tab shows the total service usage in relation to the maximum capacity that you have for a dedicated service. For example, if you have a dedicated Cloudant service, and you are using 500 GB of your 1000 GB capacity, then you see a graphic showing that you have used 50% of your total capacity. The color of the graphic changes based on how close you are to the capacity limit. Yellow is shown when you have used 70% to 84% of your capacity, and red is used when you have reached 85% or more of the available capacity.

**Note**: Service consumption information may not be available in all environments at this time. This feature is available for Cloudant, MessageHub, API Connect, and Session Cache.

**Note**: A Cloudant cluster consists of at least 3 nodes, and each document in the database is replicated across 3 nodes for high availability and disaster recovery.  Cloudant service usage information includes available space and allocated space across all nodes that make up the cluster.  For example, if a single Cloudant cluster contains 3 nodes, each with 1000 GB capacity, the capacity limit will show as 3000 GB.  The percent consumed includes all documents located on all nodes.

### Account usage

### Registering a service broker
{: #servicebrokerui}

If you have a service that you want to display in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, you must implement and register a [service broker ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html){: new_window}. After registering your broker, you can choose which orgs can access the service in your local or dedicated instance.

The methods for working with your service broker vary depending on how many services it manages, or whether it has already been registered with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

- If your service broker manages one service, you can use the user interface to register it after you have implemented the [Service Broker API ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html){: new_window}. See [Registering a service broker that manages one service](index.html#registerbrokerui).
- If your service broker manages multiple services, use the cf CLI with the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin CLI](../cli/plugins/bluemix_admin/index.html) plug-in (`ba` subcommand), or use the [Custom service API](index.html#servicebrokerapi).
- If your service broker is already registered, and you want to update or delete it, use the cf CLI with the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin CLI](../cli/plugins/bluemix_admin/index.html) plug-in (`ba` subcommand), or use the [Custom service API](index.html#servicebrokerapi).

#### Registering a service broker that manages one service
{: #registerbrokerui}

<!-- staging only start -->

Review the following information and complete the steps to register your service broker:

**Before you begin**: <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html" target="_blank">Implement the Cloud Foundry Service Broker API <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> to enable communication between your service and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The Service Broker API is a set of REST endpoints that are consumed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

When you are implementing the service broker, in the JSON response of <code>GET /v2/catalog</code>, you must provide the definitions for your service and service plans, including the service information that you want to display. For example, review the following sample JSON of the Catalog (GET) response:

## Administering organizations
{: #oc_organizations}

You can manage your organizations by creating and deleting organizations, adding or removing managers for organizations, and monitoring quota usage to make the best decisions for your business.

Click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATION**.

You can expand and view various sections. You can also review and manage the quota plans for
your organizations.

### Creating orgs

To create an organization and add managers, complete the following steps:

1. Click <strong>CREATE ORGANIZATION</strong>.
2. Enter a name for the organization
3. Enter the name or email of the person that you want to add as a manager. You can add more than one manager by entering and
selecting multiple names.
4. Click <strong>CREATE ORGANIZATION</strong> to save your changes and
create the org.

### Creating spaces

You can create spaces in your organization; for example, a *dev* space as a development environment, a *test* space as a testing environment, and a *production* space as a production environment. Then, you can associate your apps with spaces. Complete the following steps to create a space:

1. From the menu bar, click **Account** &gt; **Manage Organizations**.
2. Select the org that you want to add a space to.
3. Click **Create a Space**.
4. Enter a space name.
5. Click **Create**.

### Quota monitoring

You can expand the **Quota Monitoring** section to view the following information:

- Environment memory usage details the memory usage for the full system environment. The chart shows the following information:
<ul>
<li>The physical memory that is in use and the limit of physical memory that is availble</li>
<li>The quota of memory that is currenctly reserved and the limit of memory that can be reserved</li>
<li>The total quota of memory for your organizations</li>
</ul>
The following types of memory usage are displayed in the chart.

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Physical Used</strong></dt>
	<dd>The physical memory that is used by your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Physical Limit</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total physical memory that is available to your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Quota Reserved</strong></dt>
	<dd>The sum of memory that is reserved for all deployed applications, across all organizations. The sum of the quota that is reserved can exceed the physical limit of memory for your environment. For example, if you have a physical memory limit of 16 GB, you could reserve 4 GB of memory each for a total of five different applications. The quota that is reserved exceeds the physical limit of memory. However, in many cases, the applications might not use the total quota that is reserved individually to each application. In addition, all applications might not use
	their total quota of reserved memory all at the same time.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Reserve Limit</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total memory that can be reserved across all applications for your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Total quota</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total memory quota across all organizations.</dd>
	</dl>
	**Note**: The data is automatically refreshed every 4 hours. Click **Recalculate** if you want to refresh the data on the page before it is automatically updated.

- Organization memory usage. This section details the memory usage at an organization level. You can view the total memory quota, the quota that is reserved, and the physical memory used by each organization. The chart provides information that is listed by highest memory reserved per organization, and the organization that reserves the largest amount of memory, by default, is listed first. You can sort by **Highest Memory Usage** and **Excess Memory Allocation**.

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Highest Memory Usage</strong></dt>
	<dd>Use this option to identify the organization that has reserved the greatest amount of memory. Sort by highest memory usage to identify the organizations that have reserved the most amount of memory. The list is sorted by quota reserved. </dd>
	<dt><strong>Excess Memory Allocation</strong></dt>
	<dd>Use this option to identify organizations that have a total memory quota which is larger than needed. Sort by excess memory usage to identify organizations that are using the lowest amount of memory for the quota that has been allocated for the org. </dd>
	</dl>

### Managing quotas
{: #manageorgquota}

A quota represents the resource limits for the organizations in your environment, which is assigned when the organization is created. Any application or service in a space within the organization contributes to the usage of the allocated quota. Complete the following steps to manage the quota for an organization:

<ol>
<li>Click the bar in the chart for the organization that you want to edit in the Organization memory usage section, or select the name of the org from the Organization List section. From the Organization Information page, you can rename the organization and add or remove managers.
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you select a quota plan that is not sufficient for the current usage for the organization, you receive a message.</p></li>
<li>Click <strong>Cloud Foundry</strong> or <strong>Containers</strong>.  By default, the Cloud Foundry quota page opens.
<ul>
<li>From the Cloud Foundry page, you can select a plan and view the quota details for the following resources:
<ul>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Routes</li>
<li>Memory quota</li>
<li>Application allocation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From the <strong>Containers</strong> page, you can assign values, which must be integers, for the following fields:
<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">Image Limit</dt>
<dd class="pd">The maximum number of container images that you can have in your private registry. A container image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a Dockerfile which is a read-only file that holds the operating system, the app and all of its dependencies, and describes how a container is configured. Images are shared across all members of an organization.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">Memory Allocation Default</dt>
<dd>The amount of container memory that is automatically allocated when a new space is created. When creating a container, you must choose a container size. The size determines the amount of memory that the container can use on the compute host and counts toward your container memory limit. </dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">Memory Allocation Maximum</dt>
<dd>The maximum amount of container memory that can be allocated across all spaces of an organization.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">Floating IPs Default</dt>
<dd>The number of public IP addresses that is automatically allocated when a new space is created. You can bind public IP addresses to single containers and container groups to make them accessible from the internet.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">Floating IPs Maximum</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of public IP addresses that you cal allocate across all spaces of an organization.</dd>
</dl>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you do not yet have containers in your environment or if you do not yet have the containers in your environment set up, you get an error message.
<p>For more information about containers, see [About IBM containers](/docs/containers/container_ov.html). For more information about container quotas, see [Quota and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} accounts](/docs/containers/container_planning_org_ov.html#container_planning_quota).</p>

## Managing users and permissions
{: #oc_useradmin}

You can add users singly or in groups. Commonly, users are added to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance from your company's user registry through Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). You can also view user permissions. If you are assigned **Superuser** permission, you can also set and manage permissions for other users. Click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; USER ADMINISTRATION**.

The User Administration page displays all users for the local or dedicated instance. Permissions for each user are displayed using icons in the table. Permissions can be the following: None, **Superuser**, **Basic Access**, **Catalog**, **Reports**, and **Users**.
The **Superuser** and **Basic Access** permissions can be set to **On** or **Off**, while the remaining permissions are enabled or disabled with specific access types, including **Read** or **Write** access for that permission, as represented by icons. See [Permissions](#permissions) for descriptions of each type and explanation of the icons.

### Working with users
{: #workwithusers}

Depending on your **Read** or **Write** access for the users' permissions, you can search for existing users, remove users, and add users individually or by a group. If you have the **Superuser** permission, you have full access to complete any tasks for user management in the environment. Review the following user management tasks and the level of access needed to complete each task:

* Locate users. If have **Read** or **Write** access and you know all or part of the user name, you can locate users in the table by using the **Search** field. You can also filter the list of users by their organization and permissions. To filter a list of users, complete these steps:
  <ol>
  <li>Click <strong>Filter</strong>.</li>
  <li> Click <strong>Organizations</strong> or <strong>Permissions</strong>, depending on which you want to filter by.
  <dl>
	<dt><strong>Organization</strong></dt>
	<dd>To filter users by their organization, begin typing the organization name in the <strong>Organization</strong> field and select the organization from the list. Then select the role, or roles, assigned to the users within the organization.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Permissions</strong></dt>
	<dd>To filter users by their permissions, first select the type of user, or users. For example, you might want to see all of the Superusers. For permissions other than <strong>Superuser</strong> or <strong>Basic Access</strong>, you can also select the type of access, for example <strong>Read</strong> or <strong>Write</strong>.</dd>
	</dl></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
   </ol>

   The User Administration window shows the filters that you set and the users that resulted from the specified filters. You can then search for a user in the filtered table. You can also modify the list of specified filters by removing a filter option from the list.

* Add a single user. If you have **Superuser** permission or
**Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

  1. To add a single user from your LDAP directory, click **Add User**.
  2. In the **Search** field, type the email address for the user, and then select the user from the populated list.
  3. Next, from the **Org** field, choose the org to which you want to add the user by entering the org name and selecting it from the populated list.
  4. To add the user to the selected org, click **Add User**.

  **Note**: When the add operation is successful, the user is added to the table for you to view and search. When users are added, they have no assigned permissions.

* Add a group of users from your LDAP directory. If you have **Superuser** permission or
**Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

  1. Click **Add User Group**.
  2. In the **Search** field, type a group name to search, and select the group name from the populated list.
  3. Next, from the **Org** field, choose the org to which you want to add the user group by entering the org name and selecting it from the populated list.
  4. To add the user group to the selected org, click **Add Users**.

  **Note**: Groups of more than 50 users are added through a background batch job. When the add operation is successful, the user or group is added to the table for you to view and search. When users are added, they have no assigned permissions.

* Add a group of users by importing a spreadsheet that includes user IDs, user email addresses, and the organization to which you plan to add the user. If you have **Superuser** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

**Note**: Enter user IDs that match the values used in your user registry.

  1. Click **Import users**.
  2. Click **Download Template (.CSV)** to download a spreadsheet with the required columns that you can fill in, or you can create your own by using a spreadsheet that includes the required column headers: **User ID**, **Email**, and **Organization**.  Two optional columns are also included in the template: **First Name** and **Last Name**.
  3. Fill in the user values for the required columns. If you are not using an LDAP directory, use the required and optional column headers for the users that you are importing.
  4. Save your file, and click **Upload file**.

  **Note**: The columns within your spreadsheet can be in any order as long as you have all of the required columns. If the import was successful, you receive a confirmation message that states that all users were added. If the import was successful for some users, but not others, review the error message to take action on the users that could not be added.

* Remove users. If you have **Superuser** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access, you can remove users from the environment permanently.

    1. Locate the user and click the ![Delete](images/icon_trash.svg) icon.
    2. Click **Remove**.

* Editing permissions and organizations to which users belong requires you to have **Superuser** permission. To edit permissions for users, locate the user and click the user name. From the **Edit User** page, you can enable or disable permissions:

    * Select **On** from the list to enable the **Superuser** or **Basic Access** permission.
    * Select **Read** from the list to allow the user to have **Read** (read-only) access for that permission, or select **Write** to allow **Write** (edit, or add and remove) access for that permission.
    * Select **Off** to disable any of the permissions.

    **Note**: Setting the **Superuser** permission to **On** sets all other permissions with **Write** access.

* To add or remove a user from a specific org, you must have **Superuser** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access.

    1. To add a user to an org, select the user name from the table to access the **Edit User** page. Then, use the search field to locate an org, select the org from the list, and click **Save**.
    2. To remove a user from an org, select the user name from the table to access the **Edit User** page. Then, click ![Remove](images/icon_remove.svg) for the org from which you want to remove the user, and click **Save**.

* To view information about the organization the user is assigned to, click the organization name to display Organization Information. You can then click the user name to return to view User Information.

### Permissions
{: #permissions}

Users can be assigned the following permissions with specific access levels (read or write) that enable the user to complete specific tasks within the admin console.


{: #ld_table14}

| **User permission** | **Description** |       
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Superuser | Users with **Superuser** permission set to **On** are allowed to edit permissions for other users. If you have the permission on, it automatically enables full access to all other permissions. In addition to the tasks outlined for each permission in this table, they can also set up notification subscriptions to get alerted directly about maintenance or incidents, schedule maintenance, run verification checks on console components, and create orgs and spaces for the environment. This permission is equivalent to the administrator (admin) role for the admin console.  |
| Basic Access | Users with **Basic Access** permission set to **On** are allowed to see the Administration page option in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface. Users with the permission enabled can access the [System Information](#oc_system) and [Resource Usage](#oc_resource) tiles. Without this permission, users cannot see or access the Administration menu option. This permission is equivalent to the administrator (admin) role for the admin console. This permission is equivalent to the previously used login permission for the admin console. |
| Catalog | Users with **Catalog** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** or **Write** (modify) which services are available in the local or dedicated instance. Read access allows the user to access the Catalog Management tile to view available services. Write access allows the user to access the [Catalog Management](#oc_catalog) tile to view services, edit the visibility of services, register custom services, and control the buildpack priority list. |  
| Reports | Users with **Reports** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** or **Write** (modify) security reports. Read access allows the user to access the Reports and Logs tile to download reports. Write access allows the user to view the [Reports and Logs](#oc_report) tile as well as use the CLI to upload new reports and create new categories for users to access. |
| Users | Users with **Users** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** (view) the list of users or **Write** (add or remove) users. This permission doesn't allow you to set permissions for other users. Write access allows the user to add new users to the environment, delete users from the environment, and add existing users to organizations that already exist within the environment. In addition, **Write** access allows the user to add new organizations, delete organizations, and edit the users within the organizations. |
{: caption="Table 14. Permissions" caption-side="top"}

## Using REST APIs
{: #auth_adminapi}

To use the REST API commands, you first need to autheticate. To generate and support sessions, you can use cURL commands to accomplish the following tasks:

* [Loggin in to the Admin Console](#auth_loginapi)
* [Storing your user ID and password](#auth_setuidpw)
* [Storing cookies](#auth_apistorecook)
* [Reusing cookies](#auth_apireusecook)

### Logging in to the Admin Console
{: #auth_loginapi}

Before you can run any `Admin` API requests, you must log in to the Admin Console.

To log in to the Admin Console, you can use basic access authentication on the
`https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/login` endpoint. The server returns a cookie with your
session. You use that cookie for all operations with the Admin Console.

**Note:** The session becomes invalid if not used for a few hours.

To log in to the Admin Console, run the following command:

`curl --user <user_id>:<password> -c ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/login | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">--user <em>user_id</em>:<em>password</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Accepts the user ID and password and sends a Basic Authorization header.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">-c <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Stores the specified user ID and password as a cookie in the specified file.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Retrieves the specified user ID and password as a cookie in the specified file.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">--header</dt>
<dd class="pd">Sends an Accept header.</dd>
</dl>

The following example shows output from this
command:
```
{
    "message": "Logged in",
    "name": {
        "familyName": "*last_name*",
        "givenName": "*first_name*"
    }
}
```
{: screen}

### Storing your user ID and password
{: #auth_setuidpw}

You can also store your user ID and password so that you don't have to enter it manually each time you log in.  To store your user ID and pasword for reuse, use the following cURL example:

`curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Basic <redacted>" -H "Accept: application/json" "http://localhost:3000/login"`
{: codeblock}

To set up your log in information in a separate file and then call the file so that you don't have to re-enter it for each authentication request, use the `--netrc` option provided by the cURL command.

To use the `--netrc` option with cURL first create a file in the home directory of the user in one of the following ways:
* On a Unix system, create a file named .netrc
* On a Windows system, create a file named _netrc.

In the file, enter the following information:

`machine console.<region>.bluemix.net
login <id>
password <password>`
{: codeblock}

When invoking a cURL command, add the following argument: `--netrc`.
<p>To use a netrc file located in a different directory, use the `--netrc-file [file]` option, where `[file]` is the location of the netrc file.</p>
</li>
</ol>


### Storing cookies
{: #auth_apistorecook}

When you log in to the Admin Console, the server returns a cookie with your session. That cookie is required as part of the login process for future API calls for all operations with the Admin Console. You can store cookies for later use.

To store cookies after you log in, use the `-c` option, as shown in the following CURL example:

`curl --user <user_id>:<password> -c ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/login | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

### Reusing cookies
{: #auth_apireusecook}

To reuse cookies, use the `-b` option with the cookie file name that you assigned with the `-c` option, as shown in the following CURL example:

`curl --user <user_id>:<password> -b ./cookies.txt`
{: codeblock}

## Managing users with the Admin REST API

{: #usingadminapi}

You can use the `Admin` REST API to add and remove users for your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance.
The `Admin` REST API endpoints and JSON responses are provided on an experimental
basis to enable basic operations from a command line. The endpoints and URLs in the examples in this
information might change or might be discontinued at short notice.

If you have **Superuser** permission or **Users**
permission with **Write** access, you can add or remove users. You must have
**Superuser** permission to edit other users' permissions.

Though you can choose to use other tools, the following tools are prerequisites for using the examples that follow:
use other tools as well.
* cURL, to enter REST API requests as commands. cURL is a free utility that you can use to send
HTTP requests to a server and receive the server responses through a command-line interface. You can
download cURL from the [cURL Download site ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html){: new_window}.
* Python, to use the Python pretty-print JSON tool. This optional tool takes the JSON text as
input and provides easy-to-read output. You can download Python from the [Python Downloads site ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads){: new_window}.


### Listing organizations
{: #listingorg}

When you add a user, you must specify an organization. You can use the
`Admin` REST API to list all organizations. You must have
**Users** permission with **Read** access to list
organizations.To list all organizations, run the following command:

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/organizations | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">

<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>

</dl>

For each organization, the results include the following information:
* `"guid"`, GUID of the organization
* `"name"`, name of the organization

The following example shows output from this command:
```
{
     "resources": [
         {
             "guid": "05af098d-d476-4fb0-8b87-a84350e72af3",
             "name": "org-1"
         },

### Listing users
{: #listingusr}

You can determine whether a user was already added to your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment by
using the `Admin` REST API to list registered users. You must have
**Users** permission with **Read** access to list registered
users.To list all users, run the following command:

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>
</dl>

For each registered user, the results include the following information:
* `"first_name"` (given name) and `"last_name"` (surname)
* `"user_id"`, user ID and email address
* `"guid"`, GUID of the organization.
* `"permissions"` that are assigned to the user for the Admin Console.

The following example shows output from this command:

```

### Adding a user

You can use the `Admin` REST API to add users to the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. You must
have **Users** permission with **Write** access to add
users, or the **Superuser** permission (ops.admin) for the admin console. Additionally, as the Admin, you can allow organization members who do not have general admin console `user` or `superuser` permission the ability to add new users to their organization only. Use the following API command for this specific capability for organization managers:

```
PUT console.<subdomain>.bluemix.net/codi/env_config/allow_managers?flag=<TRUE or FALSE>
```
{: screen}

You can add one user or a list of users. You can add users to a single
organization, or to multiple organizations.To
add a user, you must provide the following information:

* First name (given name) and last name (surname) of the user. Provide the
`"first_name"` and `"last_name"` from [Listing users](index.html#listingusr).
* Email address and user ID: Provide the `"user_id"` from [Listing users](index.html#listingusr) for both the email address and the user ID.
* `"guid"`. Provide the GUID of the organization from [Listing organizations](index.html#listingorg).

You provide the information in a JSON file.

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
<li>Create a JSON file that contains the information in a proper JSON format.
<p>For example, create a file that is named `user.json` that has the
following content:</p>
<pre>
{
    "members": [
        {
            "emails": [
                "some_user_id@domain.com"
            ],
            "first_name": "Some_first_name",
            "last_name": "Some_last_name",
            "user_id": "some_user_id@domain.com"
        }
    ],
    "organization_roles": [
        {
            "id": "7a891f9c-e4e7-46c7-8b4e-dffaa7eb3bcd"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Post the content of the JSON file to the user's endpoint by running the following
command:<br/><br/>
<code>
curl -v -b ./cookies.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @./user.json https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users
</code>
</li>
</ol>

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-v </dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies verbose output.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">-X POST</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies a POST request, overriding the default GET request.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">-H "Content-Type: application/json"</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies the content-type header, which in this case is JSON.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">-d *data*</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies the data, in this case the file `user.json`, to be sent in POST

### Removing a user

You can use the `Admin` REST API to remove users from the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. You must
have **Users** permission with **Write** access to remove users.

To remove a user, you must provide the user ID of the user. Run the following command:

`curl -v -b ./cookies.txt -X DELETE https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users?user_id=<some_user_id@domain.com>`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-X DELETE</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies a DELETE request.</dd>

## API for metrics
{: #envappmetricsapi}

You can use four APIs to gather metrics about your environment, applications and organizations. These APIs return an array of data points for the metrics that you requested over the time that you specified.


The Metrics APIs that are described in the following sections can be accessed from the region-specific endpoint, for example:

`https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/admin/metrics`
{: codeblock}

**Notes**:

1. A user can make up to 200 API requests for metrics an hour.
2. Each API request returns up to 200 data points per request. If more data is available, a URL is provided in the response for loading the next set of data.
3. Each API request requires a user to have at least Basic Access to the Administration Console.  Additional permissions might be required, as specified below.
4. Data are available up to 5 months back from the time the API request is made.

## Gathering metrics about your environment

You can use the environment API to gather high-level environment information over a time period that you specify. You can view the actual data samples, which are recorded approximately every hour, or statistics computed on the data samples. Statistics are available for memory and disk consumption only. The APIs allow you to specify the time range of the actual or statistical data returned. If, for example, you request six hours of CPU (actual) data for the environment, the response would include CPU data for each of the six requested hours.


### Environment endpoints

You can use the following endpoint to invoke this API command:  `/api/v1/env`

**Note**: One of the following permissions are required to access these endpoints: **Basic Access**, **User Read**, **User Write**, or **Superuser**

### Environment metrics query parameters

Using the following query parameters, you can gather metrics for your CPU, disk, memory, network, quota, and apps:

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">metric</dt>
<dd class="pd">One or more of the following values, separated by commas: `memory`, `disk`, `cpu`, `network`, `quota`, and `apps`.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">startTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The earliest point in time from which data is returned. If no startTime is specified, the earliest available data point is included. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify a startTime of 2 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">endTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The latest point in time from which data is returned. If no endTime is specified, the most recent data point is used. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify an endTime of 5 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">sort</dt>
<dd class="pd">The order in which the data is returned. Valid values are `asc` (ascending) and `desc` (descending). The default is descending, returning the most recent data first. </dd>
</dl>

The following example uses the query parameters to gather metrics about your environment:

```
curl -b ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/admin/metrics/api/v1/env?metric=cpu,network,disk,apps,memory
```
{: codeblock}

### Environment statistics endpoints

You can view statistics computed on the metrics data for your environment's memory and disk consumption. Statistics returned are the average, the maximum and the minimum values of the data samples in each grouping of data. Data can either be grouped by day, where the statistics are computed for each day, or by month, where the statistics are computed for each month.

You can use the following endpoints to invoke this API command:
* `/api/v1/env/stats/system/disk`
* `/api/v1/env/stats/system/memory`

**Note**: One of the following permissions are required to access these endpoints: **Basic Access**, **User Read**, **User Write**, or **Superuser**

### Environment statistics query parameters

Using the following query parameters, you can gather statistics for your disk and memory:

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">startTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The earliest point in time from which data is returned. If no startTime is specified, the earliest available data point is included.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">endTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The latest point in time from which data is returned. If no endTime is specified, the most recent data point is used.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">averageType</dt>
<dd class="pd">The grouping on which to compute statistics. Valid values are `day` and `month`. The default is day, returning the average usage values for each day in the specified time range.  Specifying a value of month returns the average usage values for each month.</dd>
</dl>

The following example uses the query parameters to gather memory statistics about your environment, averaged by day:

```
curl -b ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/admin/metrics/api/v1/env/stats/system/memory
```

## Gathering metrics about your organizations

Data is recorded for all organizations approximately every hour. A request for a particular metric returns information for all organizations in each data sample in the time period you specify, which is sorted in descending order by the requested metric. For example, requesting all organizations by memory over a 6-hour time period in an environment that has 200 apps returns 1200 records, 200 at a time.

To reduce the amount of information that is returned for each data sample in the requested time period, you can specify a count option. Using the previous example and adding a count option of 5 returns 30 records that represent the top 5 organizations by memory for each data sample.

### Organizations endpoints

You can use the following endpoints to invoke this API command:
* `/api/v1/org/memory/physical`
* `/api/v1/org/memory/reserved`
* `/api/v1/org/disk/physical`
* `/api/v1/org/disk/reserved`

**Note**: One of the following permissions are required to access these endpoints: **User Read**, **User Write**, or **Superuser**

### Organizations query parameters

Use the following query parameters to gather metrics for your organizations:

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">startTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The earliest point in time from which data is returned. If no startTime is specified, the earliest available data point is included. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify a startTime of 2 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">endTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The latest point in time from which data is returned. If no endTime is specified, the most recent data point is used. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify an endTime of 5 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">count</dt>
<dd class="pd">The number of records to return within each data sample.
</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">minValue</dt>
<dd class="pd">The smallest value to return for the specified metric.  If no minValue is specified, all values are returned.  For example, to gather organizations using at least 20000 bytes of physical memory, specify a minValue of 20000.
</dd>
</dl>

The following example gathers metrics about your organizations:

```
curl -b ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/admin/metrics/api/v1/org/memory/physical?count=5&startTime=2016-12-02T16:54:09.467Z
```
{: codeblock}

### Organizations response format

```
{
   docs: [],
   next_url:
}
```
{: screen}

Each document that is returned represents the requested metrics for an organization in each data sample, at the point in time of the request.

## Gathering metrics about your applications

Data is recorded for all applications approximately every hour. A request for a particular metric returns information for all apps in each data sample in the time period you specify, which is sorted in descending order by the requested metric. For example, requesting all apps by CPU over a 6-hour time period in an environment that has 200 apps returns 1200 records, 200 at a time.

To reduce the amount of information that is returned for each data sample in the requested time period, you can specify a count option. Using the previous example and adding a count option of 5 returns 30 records that represent the top 5 applications by CPU for each data sample.

### Applications endpoints

You can use the following endpoints to invoke this API command:
* `/api/v1/app/cpu/physical`
* `/api/v1/app/memory/physical`
* `/api/v1/app/memory/reserved`
* `/api/v1/app/disk/physical`
* `/api/v1/app/disk/reserved`

**Note**: One of the following permissions are required to access these endpoints: **User Read**, **User Write**, or **Superuser**

### Applications query parameters

Use the following query parameters to gather metrics for your applications:

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">startTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The earliest point in time from which data is returned. If no startTime is specified, the earliest available data point is included. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify a startTime of 2 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">endTime</dt>
<dd class="pd">The latest point in time from which data is returned. If no endTime is specified, the most recent data point is used. For example, to gather data between 2 PM and 5 PM, specify an endTime of 5 PM.</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">count</dt>
<dd class="pd">The number of records to return within each data sample.
</dd>
<dt class="pt dlterm">minValue</dt>
<dd class="pd">The smallest value to return for the specified metric. If no minValue is specified, all values are returned. For example, to gather applications using at least 20000 bytes of physical memory, specify a minValue of 20000.
</dd>
</dl>

The following example gathers metrics about your applications:

```
curl -b ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://console.<region>.bluemix.net/admin/metrics/api/v1/app/cpu/physical?count=5&startTime=2016-12-02T16:54:09.467Z
```
{: codeblock}


### Applications response format

```
{

## Managing Access to Cloud Systems in the European Union
{: #oc_euaccess}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} personnel regularly access cloud systems to perform maintenance activities, either in response to incidents or to deploy maintenance updates. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} makes every effort to assign personnel from the European Union (EU) to perform maintenance activities on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} systems located in the EU. When this is not possible, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} might assign personnel from outside of the EU to perform maintenance on an EU cloud system. You have control over the level of approval required before {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} personnel from outside the EU can access your EU cloud system. After access is approved in accordance to your access control policies, temporary credentials are provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to the assigned personnel.

You control access through policy options available in the Administration Console. Click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; EU System Access**. The policies determine the level of approval required by the customer before {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} personnel from outside the EU can access the EU cloud system. You can set up the non-EU access policy, approve or reject access requests resulting from the configured policy, and browse the history of approval requests. The _EU System Access_ view has three tabs:
 
* Policies
* Pending Requests
* Request History

**Note:** The EU System Access option in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console is only available if your environment is configured to be an EU-managed cloud system.

### Setting up an access policy 

To manage your EU system access policy, click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; EU System Access &gt; Policy**.

In the **Policy** section, you can specify the level of approval required for IBM personnel located outside the EU to access your system. Any access by non-EU personnel to EU cloud systems requires prior IBM approval. The three available policy options determine if and when customer approval is required, including IBM approval.

<ul>
<li>No customer approval is required. IBM approved personnel from outside the European Union can access the cloud system without your approval.</li>
<li>Customer approval is always required. IBM personnel from outside the EU can access the cloud system only with explicit approval.</li>
<li>Custom policy. Your approval is required depending on the type and condition of the maintenance activity for which access is required.</li>
</ul>

When your policy calls for customer approval, you can optionally define an _Auto-approval_ period where access requests are approved automatically.

For the custom policy, the following lists and describes the various types of activities and their associated conditions:

{: #ld_table18}

| **Activity** | **Condition** | **Description** |       
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Incident | Blocker | The specified component is inaccessible or not operating as expected.  The environment is significantly impacted. There is no workaround. |
| Incident | Non-Blocker | The specified component is having intermittent issues or a portion of the component is not working as expected. The environment is not significantly impacted or there is a workaround. |
| Maintenance Update | Emergency Deployment | The update is required to resolve or prevent an incident. |  
| Maintenance Update | Normal Deployment | The update is part of a regular upgrade of a service or component to enhance its functionality, usability, reliability or performance. |
{: caption="Table 18. EU Custom Policy" caption-side="top"}

### Addressing pending requests 

To view access requests that require your attention, click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; EU System Access &gt; Pending Requests**.

In the **Pending Requests** table, you can approve or reject requests to access your EU system from IBM personnel located outside of the EU. Some information on pending requests is displayed as table columns. Additional details are provided when the table row for a given request is expanded.  

To approve or reject one or more requests, select one or more checkboxes to the left of the request and then select the **Approve** or **Reject** button. Once an access request is approved or rejected, which can be done either manually by the customer or automatically through an auto-approve policy, its record moves from the **Pending Requests** tab to the **Request History** tab. Once you approve an access request, you'll be able to see a record of the various IBM personnel accessing the system. 

**Note**: An access request is associated with a specific maintenance activity. That maintenance activity may be carried out by multiple IBM personnel. When you approve an access request, you are potentially approving access by multiple IBM personnel to the system. Each person accessing the cloud system still requires individual approval and credentials by IBM, but you only need to grant approval once for all required activity associated with the update or incident. 

Summary information for each approval request is provided in table rows. Additional information is displayed when a table row is expanded:

<dl>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd>The status of the access request: Pending, Approved, or Rejected.</dd>
<dt>Activity Type</dt>
<dd>The type of activity for which access is needed: maintenance update or incident.</dd>
<dt>Record ID</dt>
<dd>The ID of the record used to track the activity for which access is needed. The value is linked to the actual record if the activity is a Maintenance Update.</dd>
<dt>Request Date</dt>
<dd>The date and time access approval was requested from the customer.</dd>
<dt>Time to Auto-approval</dt>
<dd>The time remaining before the request is approved automatically. Applicable only if an auto-approval was specified as part of the access policy. Note that when you set an auto-approval period, the countdown for that Auto-approval starts when the personnel assigned is approved by IBM. Approval requests for maintenance updates might not have a Time to Auto-approval, even if an Auto-approval was specified as part of the access policy. If this is a pre-approval request, the detail will contain a note, indicating that it is for a specific time in the future.</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>The justification for requesting access to the cloud system.</dd>
<dt>Severity</dt>
<dd>Indicates the severity of an incident. It is displayed for incidents only. </dd>
<dt>Emergency Deployment</dt>
<dd>Indicates whether a maintenance update needs an emergency deployment.  It is displayed for maintenance updates only.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>Indicates when a request is for pre-approval as part of a maintenance update that is scheduled to be deployed in the future. When you approve such request, you are pre-approving access to the cloud system when the Maintenance Update is scheduled for deployment. Once you pre-approve a request, no further approval is required when the system is actually accessed.</dd>
</dl>

**Note**: A notification subscription can be configured to send you an email or invoke a webhook when a new access request has been created. See the section on **Notifications and notification subscriptions** for more information (/docs/hybrid/index.html#oc_eventsubscription).

### Viewing request history 

To view previous access requests for your system, click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; EU System Access &gt; Request History**

In the **Request History** section, you can view all previous access requests from IBM personnel located outside of the EU.
